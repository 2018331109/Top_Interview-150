198. House Robber

STATEMENT
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. 
Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from 
robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will 
automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum 
amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

{
public:
    int n;
    vector<int>vis;

    int dp(vector<int>& nums, int it)
    {
        if(it>=n)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        if(vis[it]!=-1)
        {
            return vis[it];
        }

        int taken=nums[it]+dp(nums, it+2);
        int skipped=dp(nums, it+1);

        return vis[it]=max(taken, skipped);
    }
    int rob(vector<int>& nums)
    {
        n=nums.size();
        vis.resize(n, -1);
        int i=0;
        int ans=dp(nums, i);

        return ans;

    }
