11. Container With Most Water

STATEMENT
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that 
the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

SOLUTION
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size() - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            int h = min(height[left], height[right]);
            int w = right - left;
            int area = h * w;

            maxArea = max(maxArea, area);

            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }

        return maxArea;
    }
};
