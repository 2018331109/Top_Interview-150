151. Reverse Words in a String

STATEMENT
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. 
The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. 
The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

SOLUTION
class Solution
{
public:
    string reverseWords(string s)
    {
        int n = s.size();
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        string result;

        while (right < n)
        {
            while (right < n && s[right] != ' ')
            {
                right++;
            }
            if (left < right)
            {
                if (!result.empty())
                {
                    result = ' ' + result;
                }
                result = s.substr(left, right - left) + result;
            }
            while (right < n && s[right] == ' ')
            {
                right++;
            }
            left = right;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
