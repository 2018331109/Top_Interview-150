34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

STATEMENT
Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of 
a given target value. If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

SOLUTION
import bisect

class Solution:
    def searchRange(self, nums, target):
        ans = [-1, -1]

        l = bisect.bisect_left(nums, target)
        r = bisect.bisect_right(nums, target)

        if l < r and nums[l] == target:
            ans[0] = l
            ans[1] = r - 1

        return ans
